# Azure Log Analytics with Azure Arc-enabled servers and Azure Monitor Agent
This guide details how to set up Azure Monitor to collect ECX log files from on-premises Windows VM server nodes, monitor them for error events, and send email alerts when errors are detected. Note that since the legacy Log Analytics agent will be deprecated by August 2024, the Azure Monitor agent is used here. This guide details how to set this up for ECX VM nodes in an on-premises environment.    

In order to use Azure Monitor Agent to analyze ECX log files, you will first need an Azure account. Then you will need to create the following resources in Azure:
1. Resource Group
2. Log analytics workspace
3. On-premises server script (download script to run on the VM)
4. Custom table
5. Data Collection Rule
     - Data collection endpoint
6. Alert Rule
     - action group

## 1. Resource Group
Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and create a **Resource Group** for this solution.
1.	Search for and select **Resource groups**.
2.	Click **Create**.
    - Select your **Subscription**.
    - Enter a unique name for your **Resource group**.
    - Choose the appropriate **Region** to used for all of the resources to be created.
3.	Click **Review + Create**.
4.	Click **Create**.

\*Note - you will use this resource group for all of the resources created for this project.

## 2. Log Analytics workspace
1.	Search for **Log Analytics workspaces** in the Azure Portal.   
2.	Click **Create**.
3.	Choose your **Subscription** and the **Resource Group** just created. Enter a unique **Name** and appropriate **Region**. Add **Tags** if needed.
4.	Click **Review + Create**.
5.	Click **Create**.

## 4. On-premises server prep

Azure Arc needs to be enabled in the on-premises server in order to send log files to Azure monitor. You will need to deploy and configure the **Azure Connected Machine agent** on your server and then connect to Azure. This can be done manually, but the simplest way to do this is to download a script to automate this process. This script will download and install the **connected machine agent** and then connect to the **Azure Monitor Agent** extension under **Azure Arc**.    

1.	Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2.	Search for and select **Servers – Azure Arc**.
3.	Click on **Add** and choose **Generate script** (for a single server) to run on your target server.    
     ![Generate Script](images/Installed%20Generate%20Script.png)
5.	Review the **Prerequisites** page and click **Next**.
6.	On the **Resource** details tab:
    - Select your **Subscription**.
    - Select the appropriate **Resource Group**.
    - Select the appropriate **Region**.
    - Select the appropriate **Operating system**.
    - Select the appropriate **Connectivity method** (usually Public endpoint).
7.	Click **Next**.
8.	On the **Tags** tab:
    - Enter values for the **Physical location tags** (if desired), and any other custom tags as needed.
9.	Click **Next**.
10.	Click **Download** and review the script execution instructions.
11.	Click **Close**. 
12.	Copy the downloaded script to your target server.
13.	Open an elevated PowerShell windows on your server, change to the directory with the script, and run _**./OnboardingScript.ps1**_.    
\*Note that you may need to change the execution policy in order to run the script. The script will prompt you to enter your Azure credentials in order to connect to Azure. An Azure Arc-enabled resource will be created for your server and associated with the agent.
13.	Verify that this succeeded by returning to the Azure portal and accessing the **Azure Arc – Servers** page. Your server should be listed with the status of _Connected_. Azure Monitor Agent should be installed as an extension of this Azure Arc server resource. The **Azure Connected Machine Agent** will have been installed on your on-premises server.

## 4. Custom table
A custom table needs to be created in the Log Analytics workspace for the log data which will be collected. The Data Collection Rule, which will be created later, will channel log file data to this table.
1.	Copy the code below and change the parameters in the braces to match your Azure environment. This code can be modified to add other columns if needed. Be sure not to add any extra spaces anywhere in the script. You will choose your own TableName (replace the place holder in two places in the script).

```
    $tableParams = @'
    {
       "properties": {
           "schema": {
                  "name": "{TableName}_CL",
                  "columns": [
           {
                                   "name": "TimeGenerated",
                                   "type": "DateTime"
                           }, 
                          {
                                   "name": "RawData",
                                   "type": "String"
                          }
                 ]
           }
       }
    }
    '@

    Invoke-AzRestMethod -Path "/subscriptions/{subscription}/resourcegroups/{resourcegroup}/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/{WorkspaceName}/tables/{TableName}_CL?api-version=2021-12-01-preview" -Method PUT -payload $tableParams
```    
2.	It is easiest to create this table from an **Azure Cloud PowerShell** command line in Azure. From the Azure portal press the **Cloud Shell** button int the top right bar. Then select **PowerShell**. Copy and paste the script and press return to execute the script.
3.	To verify that the table was made, return to your **Log Analytics workspace** in Azure and click on the **Tables** blade under **Settings**.    
\*Note that this script and instructions were found at the following [Microsoft learn link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/agents/data-collection-text-log?tabs=portal).

## 5. Data Collection Rule
A Data Collection Rule will define the data collection process in Azure Monitor. It specifies what will be collected, where to send the data, and how it will be transformed. The instructions for the following rule will collect ECX custom logs from on-premises ECX servers.
1.	Search for **Monitor** in the Azure portal to access the **Monitor** menu.
2.	Click on **Data Collection Rules** in the left blade under **Settings**.
3.	Select **Create**.
4.	On the **Basics** tab:
    - Enter a unique **Rule Name** for this rule.
    - Select your **Subscription**.
    - Select the **Resource Group** created earlier.
    - Delect the correct **Region**.
    - Select the **Platform Type** (Windows or Linux).    
  \*Note - A Data Collection Endpoint will be created later. Click **Next : Resources**.
5.	On the **Resources** tab, click **Add resources**.

15.	Enter the following in the Data source window:
    - **File pattern**: _C:\Program Files\EXPRESSCLUSTER\log\userlog*.log_.
    - **Table name**: \<_table name created previously_ – don’t forget the *_CL* at the end\>.
    - **Transform**: leave as _source_.
16.	Click **Next : Destination**.
17.	Confirm the following:
    - **Destination type**: Azure Monitor Logs.
    - **Subscription** is correct.
    - **Account or namespace** is set to your **Log Analytics workspace**.
18.	Click **Add data source**.    
The **Data source** column should have **Custom Text Logs** and the **Destination(s)** should show **Azure Monitor Logs**.
19.	Click **Next : Review + Create**.
20.	If everything looks good, click **Create**.
21.	Click on **Go to resource** to view the newly created resource.

## Verify that the text logs are being populated
1.	Open the Azure ** Monitor** page.
2.	Click on **Logs** in the left blade.
3.	Close the **Queries** popup window.
4.	Click **Select scope** in the upper left, expand your **Resource group**, select your **Log Analytics workspace**, and click **Apply**.

6.	If you have given the system enough time to collect logs and nothing is displayed for the default **Last 24 hours** period, change the **Time range** to a longer period and try again.    
\*Note that all of the log entries collected over that time period will display, including “INFO” events.
 ![Basic Log Query](images/Azure%20Monitor%20Basic%20Log%20Query.png)
7.	Enter the following query to view organized error events:
```
<log_name>_CL
| where RawData contains "ERROR"
| order by TimeGenerated asc 
| project TimeGenerated, ComputerName=tostring(split(_ResourceId, "/")[-1]), RawData
```
![Query for ERROR](images/Azure%20Monitor%20Log%20Query%20for%20ERROR.png)
\*Note that changing _contains_ to _contains_cs_ will perform a case sensitive query.

## Alert Rule
Once Azure starts collecting ECX logs, it is possible to create an Alert Rule to notify the ECX administrator when error messages are logged.
1.	Search for **Monitor** in the Azure portal to access the **Monitor** menu.
2.	Click on **Alerts** in the left blade.
3.	Click **Create -> Alert rule**.
4.	At the **Scope** tab a window called **Select a resource** should automatically pop up. Expand your **Resource group** and put a check next to your **Log Analytics workspace**. Click **Apply**.

## Addendum
Workbooks are also a good resource to use to view log data in a clean interface. Multiple logged events (from different tables, if desired) can easily be redirected to workbooks, with queries to organize the data.
### Create a Workbook for ECX Log Data
1.	Search for **Monitor** in the Azure portal to access the **Monitor** menu.
2.	Click on **Workbooks** in the left blade.
3.	Create a new workbook by clicking **New**.
4.	Click **Add** -> **Add query**.
5.	Set the following parameters:
    - **Data source**: **Logs**
    - **Resource type**: **Log Analytics**
    - **Log Analytics workspace**: click **Load all subscriptions**
    Click your subscription
    - **Time Range**: leave at default **Last 24 hours** or change to a longer period
    - **Size**: leave visualization size at default **Medium** or change
    - **Log Analytics workspace Logs Query**: enter the following
      ```
      <Tablename>_CL
      | where RawData contains "ERROR"
      | order by TimeGenerated desc 
      | project TimeGenerated, RawData, _ResourceId
      ```
6. Click **Run Query**.
7. Click on **Advanced Settings** and change the **Step name** and **Chart title** to something more meaningful.
8. Click the **Save** icon.
9. At the **Save As** window, enter a meaningful **Title**, **Resource group**, and **Location**.
10. Click **Apply**.
11. Click **Done Editing**.    
This workbook can be pinned for easy access and will automatically update as new log events are captured, with no need to run the query when it is opened. If there are no results in the windows, edit the Time Range.
